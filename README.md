Generates structured insights including fit score, strengths, and missing skills. Includes a roadmap toward integrating GitHub/LinkedIn signals for unified candidate scoring.

### **2. Synthetic Stock Data Generator**  
A generative modeling system using an Autoencoder–GAN hybrid to create realistic synthetic OHLCV stock data. Includes latent-space learning, GAN synthesis, reconstruction pipelines, downstream evaluation, and an interactive Gradio dashboard for visual real vs synthetic time-series comparison.

### **3. Mark’s Guitar Assistant**  
A full-stack ML system that recommends songs and exercises to guitar learners using music-theory-driven features and clustering. Includes PCA-based embedding generation, MiniBatch K-Means difficulty tiers, cosine-similarity recommendations, and a FastAPI backend deployed with Docker and a custom frontend.
